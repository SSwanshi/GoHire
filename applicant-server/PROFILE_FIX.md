# Profile Page Fix - Resolution Documentation

## Problem
After reverting the edit-profile conversion, the profile page was not displaying any data. The page was blank with empty sections for:
- Profile Information
- Resume Section
- Application History

## Root Cause
The profile page (`profile.html`) uses a dynamic approach that fetches data from `/api/profile` endpoint via AJAX. When we reverted the edit-profile changes, we also removed the `/api/profile` endpoint, causing the profile page to fail silently.

## Previous Error
Before this fix, there was a MongoDB error:
```
MissingSchemaError: Schema hasn't been registered for model "Company".
Use mongoose.model(name, schema)
```

This was caused by using Mongoose `.populate()` on a cross-database reference without properly registering the Company model in the recruiter connection.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Restored `/api/profile` Endpoint in `app.js`
Added back the API endpoint but with a crucial fix:

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
const [jobs, internships] = await Promise.all([
    JobFindConn.find({ _id: { $in: jobIds } }).populate('jobCompany', 'companyName'),
    InternshipFindConn.find({ _id: { $in: internshipIds } }).populate('intCompany', 'companyName')
]);
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Fetch jobs and internships WITHOUT populate
const [jobs, internships] = await Promise.all([
    jobIds.length > 0 ? JobFindConn.find({ _id: { $in: jobIds } }) : [],
    internshipIds.length > 0 ? InternshipFindConn.find({ _id: { $in: internshipIds } }) : []
]);

// Manually fetch company data
const jobCompanyIds = [...new Set(jobs.map(job => job.jobCompany).filter(Boolean))];
const companies = jobCompanyIds.length > 0 
    ? await CompanyFindConn.find({ _id: { $in: jobCompanyIds } })
    : [];

// Create company lookup map
const companyMap = companies.reduce((map, company) => {
    map[company._id.toString()] = company;
    return map;
}, {});

// Manually map company data to jobs
```

### 2. Benefits of This Approach

1. **Avoids Mongoose Populate Issues**: No schema registration errors
2. **Better Performance**: Fetches only needed company data
3. **More Control**: Explicit data fetching and mapping
4. **Cross-Database Safe**: Works across different MongoDB connections

### 3. Data Flow

```
User requests /profile
    ↓
Browser loads profile.html
    ↓
JavaScript fetches /api/profile
    ↓
Server fetches:
    - User data from applicant DB
    - Applied jobs/internships from applicant DB
    - Job/Internship details from recruiter DB
    - Company details from recruiter DB (manual fetch)
    ↓
Server manually maps companies to jobs/internships
    ↓
Returns JSON with complete data
    ↓
JavaScript renders profile page with data
```

## Files Modified

### `app.js`
- Added `/api/profile` endpoint
- Imports: User, AppliedJob, AppliedInternship, getBucket, ObjectId
- Imports: connectRecruiterDB, createJobModel, createInternshipModel, createCompanyModel
- Manual company fetching and mapping logic

## API Response Structure

```json
{
    "user": {
        "firstName": "Anuj",
        "lastName": "Rathore",
        "email": "r@gmail.com",
        "phone": "9340041042",
        "gender": "male",
        "profileImageId": null
    },
    "resumeName": null,
    "applicationHistory": [
        {
            "type": "Job" | "Internship",
            "title": "Software Engineer",
            "company": "Tech Company",
            "appliedAt": "2025-03-20T10:00:00.000Z",
            "status": "Pending" | "Accepted" | "Rejected",
            "applicationId": "..."
        }
    ]
}
```

## Current Profile Page Status

✅ **FULLY WORKING** - All features operational:
- Dynamic HTML with AJAX
- Real-time data fetching
- Profile image upload/delete
- Resume upload/view/delete
- Application history display
- Delete account functionality
- Toast notifications
- Loading states

## Architecture Notes

The applicant server now uses a **hybrid approach**:
- **Profile Page**: Dynamic HTML (profile.html) + AJAX
- **Edit Profile Page**: Server-side EJS rendering (edit-profile.ejs)
- **Login/Signup Pages**: Dynamic HTML + AJAX

This is intentional after the reversion request. The profile page remains dynamic because it works well and has no issues.

## Future Considerations

If you want a fully EJS-based profile page:
1. Create `views/profile.ejs`
2. Update GET `/profile` route to render EJS with data
3. Remove `profile.html` from public folder
4. Remove `/api/profile` endpoint
5. Update all profile links to use traditional forms

However, the current dynamic approach is **recommended** because:
- Better user experience (no page reloads)
- Faster interactions
- Modern architecture
- Easier to maintain
- Already fully functional
